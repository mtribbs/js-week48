//STATEMENTS & EXPRESSIONS

// EXPRESSION
// a piece of code that will produce a value
// 3+4 is an expression, it produces a value (7)
// 1992 is also an expression, it's a value
// boolean, true && false && !false, is an expression, it produces a boolean value


// STATEMENT
// a bigger piece of code that is executed
// does not produce a value by itself
// made up by expressions, smaller pieces
// statement - sentence, expressions - words 

// we write code as sequences of actions, and those actions are statements
// e.g. if/else statement

if (23>10) {
    const str = "23 is bigger";
}
// the if/else block is a statement, it does not produce a value, it performs an action
// the string "23 is bigger" is an expression, it has a value
// statements end with ;
